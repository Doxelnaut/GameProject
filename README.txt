Pistol Cave

Pistol Cave is an isometric RPG.

How to Play:
The start screen gives you three options: Join Game, Host Game, and Exit. Exit is simple.
Host Game starts the server, which doesn't run a playable game, but creates a connection
between up to 2 players. Join Game connects to the server and lets you play the game.

The character is controlled with the WASD keys on the keyboard. These keys or combinations
of keys move the character in 8 directions. The F key fires the gun in the direction of the 
mouse pointer.
